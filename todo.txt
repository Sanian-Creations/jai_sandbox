DLLs 1: how does calling to dlls work?
DLLs 2: Specifically, dlls of this language which may have different definitions in
the context which may make calling to that dll weird because they expect the context
to have values that we do not have in OUR context.

see if I can make string concatenation with + work by using a plugin (?) or metaprogram to replace all sinstances of string + string with #run String.join(string, string);

if I set settings like "do not check array bounds" does that also apply to compile time code that i put in #run?

* stuff to try
** a macro with arbitrary amount of return values.
	something like 'or_return', that will check the return value of a procedure for null

	for this we will need to take in the procedure call as code and then we can count the number of return values by taking the
	type_of that code, getting its type info, which will give us the return arguments.

	which will check the return value for null, and return if so. If not null, it passes all return values through.
	It could work something like this:
	#+begin_src jai
	a, b, ok  := thingy();  if !ok  return;
	ok, a, b  := thingy2(); if !ok  return;
	err, a, b := thingy3(); if err  return;
	a, b, err := thingy4(); if err  return;

	// instead:
	a, b := OK(thingy(),  .LAST);
	a, b := OK(thingy2(), .FIRST);
	a, b := OK(thingy3(), .FIRST_ERR);
	a, b := OK(thingy4(), .LAST_ERR);

	a, b := OK(thingy(), .LAST, #code {
		print("couldn't get da thingy");
		return;
	});

	a, b, ok := thingy();
	if !ok {
		print("couldn't get da thingy");
		return;
	}; #discard ok;

	if !ok {
		print("couldn't get da thingy");
		return;
	};

	#+end_src
	the enum is like a bitset that can specify:
	Ok, Error, Value (exclusive, only 1 may be set)
	- Ok: extra arg with non-zero is ok (usually boolean)
	- Err: extra arg with a zero value is ok (cuz non-zero is some kind of error)
	- Val: result != err_val is ok (you have to proved the error value in this case)
	Return, Break, Continue
	- what to do in case of error. may also not specify anything and just do whatever in the code


** reinterpret cast with rvalues
	how to reinterpret-cast, or "transmute" as it is called in Odin, on rvalues (no adress)?
	#+begin_src jai
	f  : float32 = 4.5;
	i  : int     = << cast(*int) *f;         // is possible, f is a lvalue, it has a location which can be pointed to
	i2 : int     = << cast(*int) *(f * 3.3); // isn't possible because we are taking a pointer to an rvalue. So how to do this?
	#+end_src
** block returning a value
	Can you make blocks which return a value? with #insert, the syntax is `#insert thing`.
	In the case of building a body of a procedure or struct, you use `#insert -> string { ... }`.
	Here, `thing` is replaced with `-> string { ... }`. This seems to mean "codeblock returning a string".
	If this is syntactically consistent, you should be able to use this in other ways as well.
	So is this possible?
	#+begin_src jai
	six_factorial := -> int {
		x := 1;
		for 2..6 {
			x *= it;
		}
		return x;
	}
	#+end_src

** macro-making macro
	Can you make a macro which inserts another macro into the scope?
	#+begin_src jai
	macro_maker :: (magic_nr: s32) #expand { // calling this macro will insert another macro into the scope.

		// This is the macro that is inserted.
		// The value it adds to your input depends on the argument passed to macro_maker.
		add :: (value: s32) -> s32 #expand {
			return value + magic_nr;
		}
	}

	{
		macro_maker(5);  // a macro named "add" is added to the scope
		nice :: add(64); // add() will add 5 (variable can be a constant because the we are using a macro, not a function)
	}

	{
		macro_maker(411);  // a macro named "add" is added to the scope
		blazeit :: add(9); // add() will add 411
	}
	#+end_src

** how to easily get array-views
	in Odin you can easily get a slice of an array or dynamic array by typing
	#+begin_src odin
	arr   : [25] u8;
	slice :   [] u8 = arr[3:5]; // gives back slice starting at index 1 of length 2 (5-3), meaning index 5 is not included
	#+end_src

** With New(), does it initialize the memory with default values? If so, how?
** Circular dependencies with #run
	Say I have a struct, which relies on a procedure called with #run, but the procedure relies on the struct.
	What happens?

	#+begin_src jai
	Foo :: struct(num: i32) {
		arr : [#run difficult_calculation(num)] u8;
	}

	difficult_calculation :: (num: i32) -> i32 {
		dependency: Foo(5);
		result: i32;
		for dependency.arr {
			result += it_index;
		}
		return result + 10; // add 10 just te be sure that the answer can't be 0
	}
	#+end_src
